# Employee Directory App

Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. They need a smart way to for employees to share contact information with each other. In this project, you’ll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. You’ll request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

## Instructions

1 - Get and display 12 random users from The Random User Generator API

- Using photos and information that the API provides, you’ll display 12 users, along with some basic information:
  - Image
  - First and Last Name
  - Email
  - City

2 - Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user’s row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:

- Image
- Name
- Email
- Cell Number
- Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, state and post code.
- Birthdate

3 - Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.

- Display the users in a grid or table
- Add a hover state to the rows of the user table.
- Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window

## Extra Credit

1 - Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they already on the page.

2 - Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
